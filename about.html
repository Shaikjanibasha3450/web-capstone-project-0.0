<h1>About me</h1>
<hr />

<p>hello! I am Shaik Janibasha, a 3rd-year B.Tech student specializing in Data Science.</p>

<p>I am a passionate Full Stack Developer with a unique edge: I don't just build how an application works; I design how it looks. My journey involves a blend of analytical thinking derived from Data Science and creative problem-solving through web development.</p>

<p>I specialize in the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), allowing me to build dynamic, responsive, and robust web applications from the ground up. However, my skills go beyond code. With a strong background in Photoshop, HTML, and CSS, I ensure that every project I touch is aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.
